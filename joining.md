# Are you interested in joining the COMBINE-lab?

Great! Computational biology is an exciting field of research which lies in the intersection of quantitative biology, machine learning, and algorithms.  However, doing successful research in this area requires certain background knowledge and skills. and Before considering this as a research topic, and our lab as an intellectual home, please read through the following pre-requisites.


## Are you an MS student interested in doing a 523/524 project or a thesis?

  1. You might want to have a look at our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/) and the related papers, to get an idea for the flavor of problems we tackle and the type of areas in which we are interested.
  
  2. Sign up for CSE549. this course gives a perfect opportunity for both the student and lab members to know each other and find out if the collaboration would work out or not. If you don't already have an extensive background in computational biology, and you haven't taken CSE549, then I will not approve a 523 / 524 project.
  
  If you successfully complete above steps, donâ€™t hesitate to drop me an e-mail and with your CV.

## Are you a Ph.D. student?

  1. *Same as above:* You might want to have a look at our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/) and the related papers, to get an idea for the flavor of problems we tackle and the type of areas in which we are interested.

  2. *Same as above:* Sign up for CSE549. this course gives a perfect opportunity for both the student and lab members to know each other and find out if the collaboration would work out or not. If you don't already have an extensive background in computational biology, and you haven't taken CSE549, then please wait until you've satisfied this requirement to ask about joining the lab.
  
  3. Make sure you're a good fit!  The importance of *fit* between a student and advisor (and between a student and his/her labmates) cannot be over-stressed.  Before you decide to join the lab, you should explore all of your options.  CS is a rich and diverse field encompasing many important and truly intersting research areas.  Make sure that you're passionate about computational biology before dedicating yourself to PhD work in this path.  A great way to do this is to do a *small project* with us before officially joining the lab.
  
  If you successfully complete the above steps, and think you're interested in doing Ph.D. work in our lab, please send me an e-mail to set up a meeting.  Be sure to include the word "fish" in your e-mail, as evidence that you are diligent enough to read directions.
