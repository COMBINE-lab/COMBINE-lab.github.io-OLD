Our [RapMap paper](http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/32/12/i192.full.pdf+html)  appeared at ISMB 2016 as part of the proceedings track.  Avi gave a very nice talk to a full audience, explaining the many benefits of quasi-mapping!  The RapMap software is freely-available [here](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/RapMap).
